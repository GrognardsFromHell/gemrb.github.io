# Configuration and tweaks

We strive to make GemRB usable out of the box, with as little settings as possible.
That belies its configurability, so here is an assortment of pages, mostly related
to customization:

 * [GemRB.cfg and invocation options](Manpage.md) 
 * [Using different fonts](Fonts.md)
 * [Tweaking engine features](Modding.md#trivial)

# TODO Developer documentation

See separate page. .... Dev-docs.md
See IESDP for a nearly complete and up to date documentation of the Infinity Engine.
