# Basics

If this website hasn't answered all of your questions yet, here are few more resources:

 * [Frequently asked questions](FAQ.md)
 * [Common problems](Common-problems.md)
 * Did you know? [The games are buggy!](Not-our-bug.md)

# Configuration and tweaks

We strive to make GemRB usable out of the box, with as few settings as possible.
That belies its configurability, so here is an assortment of pages, mostly related
to customization:

 * [GemRB.cfg and invocation options](Manpage.md) 
 * [Using different fonts](Fonts.md)
 * [Tweaking engine features](Modding.md#trivial)

# TODO Developer documentation
