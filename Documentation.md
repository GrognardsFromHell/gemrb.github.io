title: GemRB documentation
---

# Basics

If this website hasn't answered all of your questions yet, here are few more resources:

 * [Frequently asked questions](FAQ.md)
 * [Common problems](Common-problems.md)
 * Did you know? [The games are buggy!](Common-problems.md#game-bugs)

# Configuration and tweaks

We strive to make GemRB usable out of the box, with as few settings as possible.
That belies its configurability, so here is an assortment of pages, mostly related
to customization:

 * [GemRB.cfg and invocation options](Manpage.md) 
 * [Using different fonts](Fonts.md)
 * [Tweaking engine features](Modding.md#trivial)

# Developer documentation

GemRB is a big piece of software with many subsystems and tunables. Check the
dedicated [developer documentation](Dev-docs.md) page for an overview and some
specifics.

Additionally check out [IESDP](https://gibberlings3.github.io/iesdp/), a project
that is coevolving with GemRB and stays immensely useful. It has a nearly complete
and up to date documentation of the (community's understanding of the) Infinity Engine.
