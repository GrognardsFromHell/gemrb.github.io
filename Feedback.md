title: Bugs, new features, ideas?

short page w/ link to tracker and Common problems

First keep in mind [this list](FAP).

GemRB isn't complete yet and we keep a bug list / todo on this wiki. See
the [todo](todo) and links in it before reporting a possibly known bug.
**Be verbose and describe your problem in detail or we may not be able
to help you**\! Include an accurate GemRB version number, and if
possible, backtraces for crashes, ctrl-m output for buggy
NPCs/doors/containers, area names. In case of complicated bugs, try to
provide save games, so we can reproduce them more easily.


**First, we can't do much if you're not able to \<wrap hi\>supply the
GemRB log and an *accurate* version number\</wrap\>\!**

It is logged to GemRB.log (in the GameDir or SaveDir if the first isn't
writable) and sent to the <span class="underline">standard output</span>
if available. Run GemRB from the terminal on major OSes and it will get
printed there. Since it is usually long, use [a
pastebin](http://paste.debian.net) to post it, rather than adding it to
your message directly.

0\. Double check you are using the **latest version available** for your
platform. You'll save everyone's time. If your platform is lagging
behind, <span class="underline">expect</span> to have old bugs (asking
why [cannot help](contribute)).
