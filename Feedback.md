title: Bugs, feature requests, ideas?
---

GemRB isn't complete yet plus the potential for extension is almost limitless.
We keep track of bugs, wishlist items and other project tasks on our
[tracker](https://github.com/gemrb/gemrb/issues).

# Help, I have a problem!

First, please check the [common problems list](Common-problems.md). It also
has instructions on how to find the log file. You can use a 
[pastebin service](http://paste.debian.net) to upload it, so the report will
remain readable.

To describe the problem, visit our tracker and [report a new issue](
https://github.com/gemrb/gemrb/issues/new/choose). Choose the most fitting
category and its template will help you fill in the relevant details, so
we can quickly understand what is wrong.

For discussions of any sort, rather open a thread on the forum.

It's also helpful to check that you are using the **latest version** of
GemRB. We can't help you with problems only present in old releases, plus
you're needlessly missing a lot of goodies. Go update first and check if
the problem is still present.

# Ideas, feature requests, enhancements

These are all welcome on the same tracker, though we can't promise we'll
do anything about them. However, it's a good place if you want to start
[contributing](https://github.com/gemrb/gemrb/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

If you are a packager, do let us know, so we can inform you of releases,
help upstream any patches  and consider your distributions particular needs.

# I have other feedback

If it's not fitting for the tracker, pop in on the forum, Discord or IRC
channel and share there.
