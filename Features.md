Baldur's Gate 1 | yes :heavy_check_mark:  | yes | yes | [bg1](https://github.com/gemrb/gemrb/labels/game%3A%20bg1)

Baldur's Gate 2 | yes | yes | yes | [bg2](https://github.com/gemrb/gemrb/labels/game%3A%20bg2)
Icewind Dale  2 | yes | no | no | [iwd2](https://github.com/gemrb/gemrb/labels/game%3A%20iwd2)
Any Enhanced Edition | no | no | no | [EE](https://github.com/gemrb/gemrb/issues/164)

PS:T is completable, but has some notable missing features, making it the least polished game.
IWD2 is playable quite nicely up until the Ice Temple. Both still require [a lot more
love](contribute) to reach the level of the other games.

There is also a [tiny tech
demo](https://github.com/gemrb/gemrb/tree/master/demo) bundled with GemRB,
but it requires more content to be more than a simple test case.

If you can't wait to see what improvements the next release will bring, a terse overview of what
has already been done is in the [changelog in the making](https://github.com/gemrb/gemrb/blob/master/NEWS),
updated approximately every 100 updates.
