PST is completable, but has some notable missing features, making it the least polished game.
IWD2 is playable quite nicely up until the Ice Temple. Both still require [a lot more
love](contribute) to reach the level of the other games.

There is also a [tiny tech
demo](https://github.com/gemrb/gemrb/tree/master/demo) bundled with GemRB,
but it requires more content to be more than a simple test case.
