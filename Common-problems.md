The games are full of complexity which inevitably led to a large amount of bugs and inconsistencies. You're **advised to install the community fixpacks** (especially for bg2 and pst) and to consider whether a problem you're having is from a fault in the data or in GemRB.

Fixpacks for:
- [bg2](https://www.gibberlings3.net/mods/fixes/bg2fixpack/) at Gibberlings3
- [pst](http://www.spellholdstudios.net/ie/pst-fixpack) at Spellhold Studios
- [iwd](https://www.gibberlings3.net/mods/fixes/iwd_fixpack/) at Gibberlings3
- [iwd2](http://www.shsforums.net/files/file/1085-almaterias-iwd2-fixpack/) at Spellhold Studios
- [bg1](https://sasha-altherin.webs.com/baldursgatefixpack.htm) from plainab

Here's a list of bugs that keep getting reported, but are not for us to fix:

  * BG1: Kelddath at the Song of the Morning in Temple (AR3400) should buy
    Wyvern heads (MISC52)- he does not. He gives gp for first one, but
    you can't sell anything in his store. 
      * like any temple, you can't sell stuff there; he is also scripted
        to only accept one wyvern head
  * BG1: Flooding mine (Cha.5) should trigger Wyrm's Crossing opening- does
    it? Here not, but maybe I didn't use elevator (trigger) like I
    should (prior to talking to miner)... (Pure speculation- similar
    thing reported in original, as well as in
    [BGT](http://www.shsforums.net/topic/45020-killing-davaeron-and-going-up-via-lift-do-not-trigger-chapter-5/)
    ).
  * BG2 (fixed by fixpack): in the Slums, the crazy scimitar wielding
    scimitar-thrower breaks your quickslots after attacking you (weapons
    are marked as magic claws and can't be removed)
  * some traps/infopoints are autodetected (already marked as
    detected in the area file)
      - BG2 (fixed by fixpack): bodhi's sanctum left chamber
      - BG1: Bogus trap detected in one of the containers on the upper
        floor in Travenhurst Manor (ar3320-22) in some versions of bg1. 
      - PST: AR0403 - The trapped container at 2350, 2600 shows up red
        when you havent searched for it
