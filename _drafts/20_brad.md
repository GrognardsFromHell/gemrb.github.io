title: A look into the next big thing for GemRB with Brad Allred
author: Jaka Kranjc

Brad "SyntaxError" Allred is a long time contributor that focuses mainly on internal
subsystems like text rendering, multibyte font support, input, the iOS port and
more. On the occasion of the anniversary, we talked to him about the current big
project, which will represent a leap forward for GemRB.

**1. First, how did you find your way into GemRB?**



**2. You seem to have a preference for working on various aspects of the user
interface. Is there any special reason for that?**



**3. I thought we'd be good for a while after the big text subsystem rewrite
in 2015 that took over a year. But if I remember correctly, it was the lost
text editing support and slow drawing of (MTA) text with OpenGL that prompted
the start of an even longer project â€” the subviews branch. Tell us a bit
about its origin.**



**4. What do views, subviews and all the other accreted changes bring to
the table?**



**5. The refactoring is slowly nearing completion and is currently the main 
TODO of the project. What are the remaining areas of work? Where could we
use further help?**



**6. What comes after that? (post-subviews, py3, your own plans/wishes)**



**7. Do you have a favourite IE game and do you still play it? Do you
contribute to other reimplementation projects?**



**8. Any final thoughts about IE games and GemRB 20 years later?**




_Tune in tomorrow to hear from Avenger, the maintainer that succeeded Edheldil._
