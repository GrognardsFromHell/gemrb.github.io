The GemRB team announces the availability of GemRB 0.8.7, a new minor release to kick off
a week of celebrations of the project's founding anniversary. 20 years ago Danielle Colantoni ...
Lot of things have happened since that day but G has continued to grow and flourish throughout the years.

GemRB is a portable free/libre open-source implementation of Bioware’s Infinity Engine, which
powered classic CRPGs like Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale and Planescape: Torment. The goal of
the project is to make these games available on a wide range of platforms forever, fix or avoid
old bugs, add new features and provide a superb platform for mod (and eventually game) development.

/.../

The [new release](link to full regular announcement) brings over 500 changes manifested as bugfixes, smaller features, cleanups
and an improved setup experience. More than that, it introduces a new [smarter
pathfinder](https://gemrb.org/2020/07/16/new-pathfinder-smarter-movement.html) with
bumping support and other movement related improvements. At the same time work continued
on the drawing and GUI handling rewrite — stay tuned for a deeper dive later this week.
With this anniversary release out of the way, finishing that rewrite is again our main
priority. 

As GemRB marks its 20th anniversary, **x** is optimistic about the project's future. "**some quote**". Overall it's clear that after so much time the GemRB effort is still active, slowly building the missing pieces of the Infinity Engine mosaic, revitalising older code, and working throughout the project to keep the effort vibrant for years to come. **CTA  (looking for contributors, especially gfx/sdl/shader wizards)**

A pearl to you!
