The GemRB team announces the availability of GemRB 0.8.7, a new minor release to kick off
a week of celebrations of the project's founding anniversary. 20 years ago, on the 21st of
August, the project initiator Danielle Colantoni registered it on SourceForge to try to make
it a team effort. A lot of things have happened since, but GemRB has continued to grow and
flourish throughout the years.

GemRB is a portable free/libre open-source implementation of Bioware’s Infinity Engine, which
powered classic CRPGs like Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale and Planescape: Torment. The goal of
the project is to make these games available on a wide range of platforms forever, fix or avoid
old bugs, add new features and provide a superb platform for mod (and eventually game) development.

/.../

The [new release](link to full regular announcement) brings over 500 changes manifested as bugfixes, smaller features, cleanups
and an improved setup experience. More than that, it introduces a new [smarter
pathfinder](https://gemrb.org/2020/07/16/new-pathfinder-smarter-movement.html) with
bumping support and other movement related improvements. At the same time work continued
on the drawing and GUI handling rewrite — stay tuned for a deeper dive later this week.
With this anniversary release out of the way, finishing that rewrite is again our main
priority. 

As GemRB marks its 20th anniversary, Jaka Kranjc, the current maintainer, is optimistic about
the project's future. _"Our work is not finished, but this sort of thing is like an
ultramarathon — for most of the run the goal is not within reach. Companies come and go, but
FLOSS persists!"_ 

Overall it's clear that after all this time the GemRB effort is still active, slowly building
missing pieces of the Infinity Engine mosaic, revitalising older code, extending features and
working throughout the project to keep the effort vibrant for years to come. The team is
looking for [new contributors](https://github.com/gemrb/gemrb/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md),
especially programmers with OpenGL experience, who could help them finish a drawing backend
refactoring — for better performance and to remain available on a wide berth of platforms.

A pearl to you!
