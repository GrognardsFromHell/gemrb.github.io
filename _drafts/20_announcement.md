title: The GemRB project celebrates 20 year anniversary with a new release
author: Jaka Kranjc

PR: a one pager combining screenshots, some citations from the interviews,
and perhaps the changelog, (new website since the last release), (suggest subscribing to gemrb-release?),
CTA (looking for contributors, especially gfx/sdl wizards), mention it's a whole week

WIP



The [new release](link to full regular announcement) brings over 500 changes manifested as bugfixes, smaller features, cleanups
and an improved setup experience. More than that, it introduces a new [smarter
pathfinder](https://gemrb.org/2020/07/16/new-pathfinder-smarter-movement.html) with
bumping support and other movement related improvements. At the same time work continued
on the drawing and GUI handling rewrite â€” stay tuned for a deeper dive later this week.
With this anniversary release out of the way, finishing that rewrite is again our main
priority. 

directly cued into a CTA? or a quote first, then CTA and perhaps end with an outlook

*If anyone is wondering about the release name: a small problem was blocking
the [famoust PST line](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxs3g0Xgh7k) from being
heard.*
