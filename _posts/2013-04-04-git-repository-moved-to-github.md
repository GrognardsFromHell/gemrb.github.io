This is Important for any users of cutting edge GemRB - the new repository is at
https://github.com/gemrb/gemrb

Run this to update your clone (no need to redo it):

    git remote set-url origin git://github.com/gemrb/gemrb.git
    git pull

or for developers with commit access:

    git remote set-url origin git@github.com:gemrb/gemrb.git

GitHub enables easier collaboration and code contributions, so fork away!
