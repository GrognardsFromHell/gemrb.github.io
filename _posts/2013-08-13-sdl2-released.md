title:  "SDL2 released!"

SDL, the "simple directmedia layer" we use as a base for our drawing and input, has reached a new milestone:
http://lists.libsdl.org/pipermail/sdl-libsdl.org/2013-August/089854.html

Don't get too excited though, since this will mostly affect mobile users (where we use sdl2 by default).
Now the interfaces are stable and there will be less compile-time problems when building gemrb.
Depending on the status/buggyness of their platform specific bits, we may stop using development versions
in our builds. That's about it.
