title:  "10th anniversary of GemRB and the 0.6.2 release!"
author: Jaka Kranjc

Exactly ten years ago, the project was registered on SourceForge. 
Over the years this enabled multiple people to contribute, track bugs and host releases. 
Started by a single coder who has since moved on to other things, it is now developed by a healthy team of IE fans.
To celebrate this anniversary, a new release was made. While it is minor by number, a lot of annoying bugs were
fixed since 0.6.1!

This is also a nice chance to say "thank you" to the wider IE community. 
Without the continued interest and help in the exploration of various engine bugs/features, 
our work would be a lot more daunting and much less gratifying. So thanks and keep it up! :)
