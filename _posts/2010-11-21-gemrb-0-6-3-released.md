The GemRB team is proud to announce a new (minor) release.

While hardly the biggest changes, the main highlights are the worldmap and action handling
improvements that make HoW playable. All the stores and temples now function properly, while
in BG2 users are more likely to notice that summons now have full actionbars of their
own - spellcasting summons and illusions are not useless anymore. Also noticable are the sound
improvements (no more death sounds on load) and the much less buggy sparkle graphics.

Currently only the sources are available.
