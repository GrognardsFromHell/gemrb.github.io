The port of the remaining mods to pure weidu* has been completed and they all received some extra love
on the way. They can be found here:
https://github.com/lynxlynxlynx/gemrb-mods

Click on the individual folders to see the docs for each mod. A release has been tagged,
so they can also be downloaded without git.
 

\* *10pp still requires perl â€” this will never change*
