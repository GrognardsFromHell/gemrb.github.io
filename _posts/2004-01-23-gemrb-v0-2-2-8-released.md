After exactly a month from the latest version, we finally released the 0.2.2.8 Version.

This new release includes a lot of Bug Fixes and many new features.

Now you'll be able to travel through areas, you're no more stuck in the Game's starting area.

We added support for Dialogues (actually implemented only via script) and improved the In-Game Script Engine.
Now the starting CutScenes are working almost perfectly (still need to implement some additional features
and to fix a problem with the CutSceneID Action).

GemRB v0.2.2.8 features a GAME File Importer which loads the starting game file (this means that,
for example, in BG2, Imoen, Minsc, Jaheira, Yoshimo, etc... are now present in the game)

In poor words, check yourself the new GemRB features :)

Stay Tuned
