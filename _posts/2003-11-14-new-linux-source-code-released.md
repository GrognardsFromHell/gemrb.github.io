The latest GemRB version (**0.2.1.6**) comes with many new features and a new and faster Font Blitter.

We are working to the GUI Games Scripts, in this package we included scripts for:

* Baldur's Gate
* Baldur's Gate 2
* IceWind Dale 2

The scripts are not finished but you can enjoy them and maybe learn the GUI Scripting :-)

Since one of our first purposes is the "Easy Modding", we choosed to add some 2DA Files to make GemRB more customizable.
These files are in the "override" directory. There is no need to copy them in the Game's Override directory
since GemRB checks for them directly into it's folder.

NOTE: The Internal GemRB Version number is changed, the old plugins are no more compatible with this version.
If you have an old GemRB version on your Hard Disk, please delete it before installing the new one.
