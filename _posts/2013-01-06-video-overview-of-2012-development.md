GemRB development in 2012 as a swarm of blobs:

During the forum downtime, the development continued at an elevated pace, so expect an awesome next release.
Lots of work is going into iwd2 compatibility, fizzle (a new contributor) has been ironing old ugly bugs
that nobody wanted to touch and chiv has managed to playtest pst to about 70%! Plenty of work still to be
done, but it is much more tangible now. A great start of the new year, so come and join us. :)

In particular, we're looking for someone to check if IWD:TOTL can be completed now, since the last known
blocker was fixed in the previous release.
