title:  No more discord between IRC and Discord
author: Jaka Kranjc

Our [IRC]({{ site.irc }}) and [Discord]({{ site.discord }}) channels are now linked,
so both chats can interact and do so from either place. This is done via a special
bridge and some robots, curtesy of community member @branon and the
[reactiflux team](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc).

Come and join us.
