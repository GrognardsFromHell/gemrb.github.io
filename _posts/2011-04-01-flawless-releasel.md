After a much effort, GemRB 1.0 is finally here! This version not only flawlessly supports
all the original IE games, like Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, Planescape: Torment (including
all the plot elements hidden due to bugs in the original engine - you * * KNOW * * that
there is a passionate love scene among Nameless One, FFG, Annah and a certain body-disadvantaged
floating fellow, right?), Neverwinter Nights, ToEE and Kotor, but it finally can play World of
Warcraft as well! Complete with DnD 4e rules! The release will be done shortly, in the meantime
look at the screenshot or grab a current git, branch gemrb-1.0.
