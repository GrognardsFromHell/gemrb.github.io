title: IRC channel moved to Libera Chat

Without going into the nasty drama that is the Freenode *Time of Troubles*, the project
now moved its IRC presence to [Libera Chat](https://libera.chat).

The Discord bridge is still in place, but users who prefer IRC should use
`irc.libera.chat:6697` to connect to `#gemrb` or jump in via the [web interface](https://web.libera.chat/#GemRB).
