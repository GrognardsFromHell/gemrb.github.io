During the 21st and 22nd of November the Debian project is organising an
[online MiniDebConf](https://mdco2.mini.debconf.org/) dedicated to gaming
and game development. 
The two day event is filled with longer, shorter and lightning talks â€” do
check out the [full schedule](https://mdco2.mini.debconf.org/schedule/). 

We were invited to speak about GemRB there, so tune in on the 22rd (between 
12:00 and 12:20 UTC) for a
[short talk and Q&A](https://mdco2.mini.debconf.org/talks/7-gemrb-20-years-of-the-engine-and-a-look-forward/).
