GemRB 0.8.3 released!

The GemRB team is proud to announce a new sweet release.

The text subsystem rewrite that was merged right after the previous release took a lot of effort
to stabilize (some kinks remain), but is now mostly complete. As with most under-the-hood work,
only dedicated users would spot a difference. More obvious is the support for parties larger than
6 in combination with the 10pp mod (to fix the data). The rest of our mods were also fully converted
to WeiDU for simpler installation. On top of that, the usual hundreds of fixes and polishes that
should make this one of our best releases yet!
