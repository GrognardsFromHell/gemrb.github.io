Mikol79 wrote a script to automate building and updating gemrb from source:

> If you wish to install dependencies, compile gemrb from git, and install it all in one go,
> please see the script at [this github repository](https://github.com/Exactus29/build_install_script_for_gemrb). Dependencies will only be installed if you
> are on Ubuntu, Mint, or Debian. Full instructions for its usage are at that site.
