The GemRB team is proud to announce a new (minor) release.

There were two main areas of focus, spellcasting and input. Casting is now properly difficult and time
consuming, while in the input area there were many fixes for multitouch and keyboard shortcuts. On top
of that this release brings the usual assortment of random features, bugfixes and internal cleanups.

Currently only the sources and some packages are available. You can get them from here.
