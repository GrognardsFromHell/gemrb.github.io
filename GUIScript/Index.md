title: GUIScript modules
---

GemRB implements python bindings into the core engine to enable dynamic GUI assembly
and externalising some of the rules and logic.

Most functions are available in the **GemRB** python module, while the rest can be
found in the internal **_GemRB** module. Both are implemented in 
[GUIScript.cpp](https://github.com/gemrb/gemrb/tree/master/gemrb/plugins/GUIScript).
The internal module is not to be used directly, but through python metaclasses (see
[GUIClasses.py](https://github.com/gemrb/gemrb/blob/master/gemrb/GUIScripts/GUIClasses.py)).
If a function documentation has a metaclass prototype definition, use that instead of
the main one!

What follows is a listing of available functions from both modules and some special pages.
